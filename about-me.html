                Such a lovely name, right? I wonder whose name that is. [Hint: It's my name.]

                If you can't tell, I like Taylor Swift and learning languages. Other than that, I am also kinda intrigued by astrology. I am Aquarius Sun, Taurus Moon, and Capricorn Rising [Pisces Venus as well, if you know what I mean]. By the way, I am 13 years old, yes, I am still 13 and a 9th grader. To add, I turned 13 this year. I actually think that I'm the youngest in the batch, but maybe not because I know of this Arayat guy who might be younger, but idk. If you're into MBTIs, I'm ISTP. I also like using square brackets than round brackets. They just look more aesthetically pleasing, ok.

                Now about computer science. I've always thought of CS as an easy subject, actually. Some part of me is a professional coder, but another part of me is a professional keyboard smasher, so I end up being an average "coder". My fave programming language is Python [very surprising]. That's all for now. Bye!
