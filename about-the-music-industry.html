                Taylor Swift is a singer, yes, but not just any singer. She's an American singer. Ha ha, very funny. Anyway, Taylor Swift was born on December 13th, 1989. 2 out of 2 numbers in that date will be significant later. She was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, lived in a Christmas tree farm there, then moved to Wyomissing, Pennsylvania and went to high school there.

            <p>
                Seeing Shania Twain as an idol, Taylor wanted to pursue a music career, and so submitted covers to Nashville record labels, but was rejected by all but one. RCA Records accepted her application and gave her an artist development deal. After this, her family moved to Hendersonville, Tennessee. She also transferred schools to Hendersonville High School, but eventually transferred to Aaron Academy to be homeschooled.

            <p>
                Swift worked with many people in Nashville, most notably Liz Rose, who will eventually many songs with Taylor. She left RCA Records because of their supposed lack of care for their artists.

            <p>
                While performing at the Bluebird Cafe, Taylor Swift was spotted by Scott Borchetta, who eventually signed her into his newly-founded record label Big Machine.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                We now come into the part of her life you'll most probably know of, so I'll just summarize it. Love Story, You Belong With Me, We Are Never Every Getting Back Together, I Knew You Were Trouble, 22, Everything Has Changed, Shake It Off, Blank Space, Style, Bad Blood, Wildest Dreams, Look What You Made Me Do.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I haven't listed all her hits because at this point of her career, her contract with Big Machine has ended, and so she leaves. Now that she's out of the way, Scott sold the record label to Scooter Braun (who I will now refer to as "He Who Shall Not Be Named or HWSNBN"). She then signed under Republic Records, who allowed her to own the recordings of her songs, unlike HWSNBN.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now you might have seen Taylor's Version before. This is because she is trying to re-record all her previous songs to be able to own them fully.

            <p>
                The End. (I do not know how to end this smoothly so yes !!)
